\section{Finite modules}

\subsection{Finite banach module}

    There are three different categories of finite modules over an affinoid algebra \(A\):
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The category \(\Banmod_A\) of finite banach \(A\)-modules with \(A\)-linear maps as morphisms.
        \item The category \(\Banmod_A^b\) of finite banach \(A\)-modules with bounded \(A\)-linear maps as morphisms.
        \item The category \(\module_A\) of finite \(A\)-modules with all \(A\)-linear maps as morphisms.
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:equivalent_of_categroy_of_finite_banach_module_and_algebraic_module}
        Let \(A\) be an affinoid \(\kk\)-algebra.
        Then the category of finite banach \(A\)-modules with bounded \(A\)-linear maps as morphisms is equivalent to the category of finite \(A\)-modules with \(A\)-linear maps as morphisms.
        \Yang{To be revised.}
    \end{theorem}

    For simplicity, we will just write \(\mod_A\) to denote the category of finite banach \(A\)-modules with bounded \(A\)-linear maps as morphisms.
