\section{Spectrum}

    % Let \(A\) be an integral \(\kk\)-algebra with \(\kk\) complete non-archimedean algebraically closed field.
    % For every \(\frakm \in \Spec A\), the absolute value on \(A/\frakm \cong \kk\) induces a multiplicative semi-norm on \(A\) by \(|f|_\frakm := |f \mod \frakm|\) for each \(f \in A\).

    % Suppose that we have an absolute value \(\|\cdot\|\) on \(\KK = \Frac A\) extending that on \(\kk\).
    % It induces a norm on \(A\) by restriction, denoted by \(\|\cdot\|_\eta\).

    % Then we can ``deform'' \(\|\cdot\|_\eta\) to \(|\cdot|_\frakm\) as follows:

    Let \(\kk\) be a spherically complete non-archimedean field which is algebraically closed and \(A = \kk[T]\).
    We want to consider the ``analytic structure'' on \(\mSpec A\).
    However, unlike the complex case, the set \(\mSpec A\) is totally disconnected with respect to the topology induced by the absolute value on \(\kk\) (\cref{prop:ultra-metric_space_is_totally_disconnected}).
    To overcome this difficulty, Berkovich uses multiplicative semi-norms to ``fill in the gaps'' between the points in \(\mSpec A\), leading to the notion of the spectrum of a Banach ring.

    % We first consider the local model.
    % Hence we should consider the Tate algebra \(\kk\{T\}\) instead of the polynomial ring \(\kk[T]\).

\subsection{Definition}

    \begin{definition}\label{def:spectrum_of_Banach_rings}
        Let \(R\) be a Banach ring.
        The \emph{Berkovich spectrum} \(\scrM(R)\) of \(R\) is defined as the set of all multiplicative semi-norms on \(R\) that are bounded with respect to the given norm on \(R\).
        For every point \(x \in \scrM(R)\), we denote the corresponding multiplicative semi-norm by \(|\cdot|_x\).
        
        We equip \(\scrM(R)\) with the weakest topology such that for each \(f \in R\), the evaluation map \(\scrM(R) \to \bbR_{\geq 0}\), defined by \(x \mapsto |f|_x\eqqcolon f(x)\), is continuous.
    \end{definition}
    
    \begin{example}\label{eg:spectrum_of_valuation_field}
        Let \((\kk, |\cdot|)\) be a complete valuation field.
        The Berkovich spectrum \(\scrM(\kk)\) consists of a single point corresponding to the given absolute value \(|\cdot|\) on \(\kk\).

    \begin{example}\label{eg:spectrum_of_Z_with_absolute_value_norm}
        Consider the Banach ring \((\bbZ, \|\cdot\|)\) with \(\|\cdot\| = |\cdot|_\infty\) is the usual absolute value norm on \(\bbZ\).
        Let \(|\cdot|_p\) denote the \(p\)-adic norm for each prime number \(p\), i.e., \(|n|_p = p^{-v_p(n)}\) for each \(n \in \bbZ\), where \(v_p(n)\) is the \(p\)-adic valuation of \(n\).
        The Berkovich spectrum 
        \[ \scrM(\bbZ) = \{|\cdot|_{\infty}^\varepsilon \colon \varepsilon \in (0,1]\} \cup \{| \cdot |_p^\alpha \colon p \text{ is prime}, \alpha \in (0,\infty] \} \cup \{|\cdot|_0\}, \]
        where \(|a|_p^\infty := \lim_{\alpha \to \infty} |a|_p^\alpha\) for each \(a \in \bbZ\) and \(|\cdot|_0\) is the trivial norm on \(\bbZ\).

    \begin{theorem}\label{thm:norm_spectrum_of_Banach_rings_is_nonempty}
        Let \(R\) be a Banach ring.
        The spectrum \(\scrM(R)\) is nonempty.
    \end{theorem}
    \begin{proof}
        Let \(\frakm\) be a maximal ideal of \(R\).
        Note that the pullback of residue norm on the residue field \(R/\frakm\) is bounded with respect to the given norm on \(R\).
        Replacing \(R\) by the completion of \(R/\frakm\), we may assume that \(R\) is a complete field.
        Consider the set 
        \[ \Sigma = \{ \text{norm on } R \text{ bounded by the given norm } \|\cdot\| \} \]
        with the partial order defined by boundedness.
        Since for a descending chain in \(\Sigma\), the infimum is a norm, by Zorn's lemma, there exists a minimal element \(|\cdot| \in \Sigma\).
        
        We claim that \(|\cdot|\) is multiplicative.
        Since the spectral radius \(\rho(f) = \lim_{n \to \infty} |f^n|^{1/n}\) associated to \(|\cdot|\) is power-multiplicative and bounded by \(|\cdot|\), by minimality of \(|\cdot|\), we have \(\rho(f) = |f|\) for each \(f \in R\).
        Thus \(|\cdot|\) is power-multiplicative.
        If \(|\cdot|\) is not multiplicative, then there exist \(a,b \in R\setminus \{0\}\) such that \(|ab|<|a||b|\).
        Then \(|b| \leq |a^{-1}| |ab| < |a^{-1}| |a| |b|\), which implies that \(|a| |a^{-1}| > 1\).
        Set \(r = |a|^{-1} < |a^{-1}|\) and consider \(R\left<T/r\right>\).
        Since \(r \cdot |a| = 1\), we have that 
        \[ \left|\sum_{n=0}^\infty a^n T^n\right| = \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a^n| r^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty |a|^n r^n = \sum_{n=0}^\infty 1 = \infty. \]
        The power series is not convergent in \(R\left<T/r\right>\) and hence \(1 - aT\) is not invertible in \(R\left<T/r\right>\).
        Let \(\frakn\) be a maximal ideal of \(R\left<T/r\right>\) containing \(1 - aT\).
        Consider \( R \to R\left<T/r\right> \to R\left<T/r\right>/\frakn \).
        Since \(R\) is a field, the composition is injective.
        The residue norm on \(R\left<T/r\right>/\frakn\) induces a norm \(|\cdot|'\) on \(R\) bounded by \(|\cdot|\).
        Note that \(|a^{-1}|' \leq |T| = r = |a|^{-1} < |a^{-1}|\), contradicting the minimality of \(|\cdot|\).  
    \end{proof}
        
    \begin{definition}\label{def:pullback_of_ring_homomorphism_of_banach_rings_on_spectrum}
        Let \(\varphi: R \to S\) be a bounded ring homomorphism of Banach rings.

    \end{definition}

    Note that \(\scrM(\varphi)(f^{-1}(V)) = \varphi(f)^{-1}(V)\) for each \(f \in R\) and open subset \(V \subset \bbR_{\geq 0}\).
    Hence the pullback map is continuous.

    % \end{proposition}
    % \begin{proof}
    %     Let \(U = f^{-1}(V) \subset \scrM(R)\) be a basic open subset for some \(f \in R\) and open subset \(V \subset \bbR_{\geq 0}\).
    %     The preimage of \(U\) under the pullback map is \(\scrM(\varphi)^{-1}(U) = \{x \in \scrM(S) : |\varphi(f)|_x \in V\} = \varphi(f)^{-1}(V)\).
    %     Since \(\varphi(f) \in S\), \(\varphi(f)^{-1}(V)\) is open in \(\scrM(S)\).

\subsection{Spectrum of Tate algebras}

    \paragraph{Spectrum of Tate algebra in one variable} Let \(\kkk\) be an algebraically closed complete non-archimedean field, and let \(A = \kkk\{T/r\}\).
    We list some types of points in the spectrum \(\scrM(A)\).

    \begin{construction}\label{cons:four_types_of_points_in_spectrum_of_Tate_algebra_in_one_variable}
        For each \(a \in \kkk\) with \(|a| \leq r\), we have the \emph{type I} point \(x_a\) corresponding to the evaluation at \(a\), i.e., \(|f|_{x_a} := |f(a)|\) for each \(f \in A\).
        
        For each closed disk \(E = E(a,s) := \{b \in \kkk : |b - a| \leq s\}\) with center \(a \in \kkk\) and radius \(s \leq r\), we have the point \(x_E = x_{a,s}\) corresponding to the multiplicative semi-norm defined by
        \[ |f|_{x_E} = |f|_{x_{a,s}} := \sup_{b \in E(a,s)} |f(b)| \]
        for each \(f \in A\).
        If \(s \in |\kkk^\times|\), then the point \(x_E\) is called a \emph{type II} point; otherwise, it is called a \emph{type III} point.
        
        Let \(E_n = E(a_n,s_n)\) be a sequence of closed disks in \(\kkk\) such that \(E_{n+1} \subsetneq E_n\) and \(\bigcap_n E_n = \emptyset\).
        Then we have the point \(x_{\{E_n\}} = x_{\{a_n,s_n\}}\) corresponding to the multiplicative semi-norm defined by
        \[ |f|_{x_{\{E_n\}}} = |f|_{x_{\{a_n,s_n\}}} := \inf_n |f|_{x_{E_n}} \]
        for each \(f \in A\).
        Such a point is called a \emph{type IV} point.
        \Yang{To be completed. Check the definition of type IV points.}
    \end{construction}
    % \end{example}

    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:four_types_of_points_in_spectrum_of_Tate_algebra_in_one_variable}
        The points in the spectrum \(\scrM(\kkk\{r^{-1}T\})\) can be classified into four types as described above.
        % \Yang{To be checked}
    \end{proposition}
    \begin{proof}
        Fix \(x \in \scrM(\kkk\{r^{-1}T\})\), set 
        \[ s = \inf_{a \in \kkk} |T - a|_x \leq r,\quad  E = \{a \in \kkk : |T - a|_x = s\} \subset E(0,r). \]

        \begin{case}\label{case_in_proof_of_four_type_points:point_type_I}
            \(E \neq \emptyset\) and \(s=0\). 
        \end{case}
        By assumption, there exists \(a \in E\) such that \(|T - a|_x = 0\).
        Note that if \(f(a) = 0\), then \(T-a \mid f\) in \(\kkk\{r^{-1}T\}\) and hence \(|f|_x = |T - a|_x|g|_x = 0\).
        Then we have 
        \[ |f(a)| = \big| |f(a)| - |f(a) - f|_x \big| \leq |f|_x \leq |f(a)| + |f(a) - f|_x = |f(a)| \]
        for each \(f \in \kkk\{r^{-1}T\}\), which implies that \(|f|_x = |f(a)|\).
        Thus \(x\) is a type I point \(x_a\).

        \begin{case}\label{case_in_proof_of_four_type_points:point_type_II_and_III}
            \(E \neq \emptyset\) and \(s > 0\).
        \end{case}
        % Next suppose that \(E \neq \emptyset\) and \(s > 0\).
        Let \(a \in E\).
        Note that for every \(b \in \kkk\), we have 
        \[ |a-b| \leq \max\{|T - a|_x, |T - b|_x\} = |T - b|_x. \]
        First we show that \(E = E(a,s)\).
        For each \(b \in E(a,s)\), we have \(|T - b|_x \leq \max\{|T - a|_x, |a - b|\} = s\), which implies that \(b \in E\).
        Conversely, for each \(b \in E\), we have \(|a - b| \leq \max\{|T - a|_x, |T - b|_x\} = s\).

        Let \(f \in \kkk[T]\) be a polynomial.
        Write \(f = \prod_{i=1}^n (T - c_i)\) for some \(c_1, \ldots, c_n \in \kkk\).
        Then we have
        \[ |f|_x = \prod_{i=1}^n |T - c_i|_x \geq \prod_{i=1}^n |b - c_i| = |f(b)|, \quad \forall b \in E. \]
        I claim that for every \(\varepsilon \in (0,1)\), there exists \(b \in E\) such that \(\varepsilon |T-c_i|_x < |b - c_i|\) for each \(i = 1, \ldots, n\).
        Indeed, if \(c_i \notin E\), then \(|T-c_i|_x = |b - c_i|\) for each \(b \in E\).
        Hence we only need to consider the case when \(c_i \in E\).
        Since \(\kkk\) is algebraically closed, \(E(a,s) \setminus \bigcup_{i=1}^n E(c_i,\varepsilon s) \neq \emptyset\).
        Choose \(b\) in the set.
        Then we have 
        \[ |f(b)| \geq \prod_{i=1}^n \varepsilon |T - c_i|_x = \varepsilon^n |f|_x. \]
        Thus \(|f|_x = \sup_{b \in E} |f(b)|\) for each polynomial \(f \in \kkk[T]\).
        Since polynomials are dense in \(\kkk\{r^{-1}T\}\), we have \(|f|_x = \sup_{b \in E} |f(b)|\) for each \(f \in \kkk\{r^{-1}T\}\).
        Therefore, \(x\) is the point \(x_E = x_{a,s}\), which is of type II or type III depending on whether \(s \in |\kkk^\times|\) or not.

        \begin{case}\label{case_in_proof_of_four_type_points:point_type_IV}
            \(E = \emptyset\).
        \end{case}

        Set \(E_n = \{a \in \kkk : |T - a|_x \leq s + 1/n\}\) and \(a_n \in E_n\) for each \(n \in \bbN\).
        By the similar argument as in \cref{case_in_proof_of_four_type_points:point_type_II_and_III}, we have \(E_n = E(a_n, s + 1/n)\).
        Note that \(E_n\) is a decreasing sequence of closed disks with \(\bigcap_n E_n = E = \emptyset\).
        
        For \(c \in \kkk\), there exists \(N\) such that \(\forall n \geq N\), we have
        \[ c \notin E_n \implies |T - c|_x > |T - a_n|_x \implies |T - c|_x = |a_n - c|. \]
        Thus
        \[ \inf_n |T-c|_{E_n} = \inf_n |a_n - c| = |T - c|_x. \]
        By multiplicativity, we have \(\inf_n |f|_{E_n} = |f|_x\) for each polynomial \(f \in \kkk[T]\).
        And then by density of polynomials, the equality holds for each \(f \in \kkk\{r^{-1}T\}\).
        Therefore, \(x = x_{\{E_n\}} = x_{\{a_n,s_n\}}\) is of type IV.
