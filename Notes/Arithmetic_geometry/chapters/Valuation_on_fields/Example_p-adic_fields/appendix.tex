    \begin{proposition}\label{prop:completion_of_algebraically_closed_valuation_fields_is_algebraically_closed}
        Let \(\kk\) be an algebraically closed non-archimedean field.
        Then its completion \(\widehat{\kk}\) is also algebraically closed.
        % \Yang{To be checked.}
    \end{proposition}

    \begin{corollary}\label{prop:residue_field_of_completion_is_equal_to_the_original_fields}
        Let \(\kk\) be a non-archimedean field and \(\widehat{\kk}\) its completion.
        Then the residue field \(\calk_{\widehat{\kk}} \cong \calk_\kk\) under the natural embedding \(\kk^\circ \hookrightarrow \widehat{\kk}^\circ\).
    \end{corollary}

    \begin{corollary}\label{prop:valuation_group_of_completion_is_equal_to_the_original_fields}
        Let \(\kk\) be a non-archimedean field and \(\widehat{\kk}\) its completion.
        Then the valuation group \(|\widehat{\kk}^\times|\) of \(\widehat{\kk}\) is equal to the valuation group \(|\kk^\times|\) of \(\kk\).
    \end{corollary}
